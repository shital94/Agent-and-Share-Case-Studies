**#Agent and Share Case Studies**
Associates are tasked with allocating Physical Sequential Files and Partioned Data Sets in order to process sample data.
The first case study involves simulated data relating to insurance agents and policies. Associates are tasked to process data using methods
such as sorting, duplicate elimination, field-based filtering, splitting records across multiple files, and merging multiple files into one file. JCL
utilities such as SORT, IEBGENER, and IEFBR14 are used.
The second case study involves data relating to corporation shares. Associates are tasked with writing/processing data, moving data to
different clusters (ESDS and KSDS), building indexes, and creating backups of data using GDG. JCL utilities used include SORT, IEFBR14,
and IDCAMS.
